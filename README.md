## Objective

Utilize Object Constructors to create a Library app, where the user will be able to input a books title, author, how many pages it is, and whether they have read it or not.

The user should be able to click an 'add' button to bring up a pop up form, with fields for the book's information. After user enters information and hits submit, a 'card' is created using that information.

User will be able to change the read status and remove a book from their library.
